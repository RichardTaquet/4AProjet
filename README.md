# 4AProjet
Presentation

This is supposed to be an app using a Pokemon API rest in Kotlin.

Problems encountered

Despite following the videos, errors that I just couldn't find kept popping up.
Git doesn't seem to work as it is supposed to.
Ever since I did the PokeRepository the app constantly and instantly crashes, but dont know why and cant find a way to go back to before.
Since I couldnt get this to work I didnt manage to add the remaining functions asked.

Functions

App uses MVVM architecture and respects SOLID principles.
It used to have a second screen and saved data on the cache. This isn't the case anymore since the app just doesnt launch anymore.
Uses singletons for recurring objects.
